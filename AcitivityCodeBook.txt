The current dataset is cleaned and aggregated from the original data set:

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.  Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
- Its activity label. 
- Mean of all the variables for the activity for the subject
- Means and Standard deviation of Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Means and standard deviation of Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 


Here are the details of the variables

1 subject 			Subject identifier
2 activitylabel 	Activity done by the subject
						Different activities are: 
							LAYING, SITTING, STANDING
							WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS
							WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS

activityMean		Mean of all the variables for all the particular activity for the subject
                        Basically this the row mean of the origianl dataset


The means and standard deviation of the signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern.
The variables are:
- The mean acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X/Y/Z axis in standard gravity units 'g'. 
- The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
'meam or std' is used to denote which aggregation is used
