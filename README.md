#Dataset should be in the appropriate directories before you run this code 
- test directory should contain the test data set as given
- train director should contain train data set as given

The code beook for the tidy data set generated by this program is in ActivityCodeBook.txt

The code reads all the files from the appropriate directories
It merges the data and just extracts the mean and standard deviation columns

It produces a mean of all variables and then aggregates the data by subject and activity


The final data set produced is in TidyDataSet.txt

In addition the code also shows a tabular report (TabularReport.txt) from the data set
